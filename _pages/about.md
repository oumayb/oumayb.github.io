I'm a last year PhD student in the [WILLOW project-team](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/index.php) which is a joint team between Inria Paris, the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.ens.fr) of Ecole Normale Supérieure, and CNRS. I'm advised by [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io) and [Jean Ponce](https://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/).  
Prior to that, I received an engineering degree from Télécom Paris.   
My work focuses on learning representations of dynamical systems from sensor measurements.     
My research interests lie in robotics and control, computer vision and machine learning.
